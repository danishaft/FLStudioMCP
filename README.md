# fLMCP — The most powerful FL Studio MCP server

**Model Context Protocol server that gives Claude (or any MCP client) end-to-end
control of FL Studio — transport, patterns, channels, mixer, plugins, piano
roll, playlist, arrangement, automation, rendering, high-level generators for
beats / chords / basslines / arpeggios / melodies, plus voice-to-MIDI humming
and full audio-file analysis (MP3 → FL piano roll).**

Built from scratch to improve on three earlier community attempts

## Highlights

- **No loopMIDI dance.** FL Studio 2025 ships Python 3.12 with `_socket.pyd`,
  so the bridge opens a tiny TCP server inside FL (`127.0.0.1:9876`). No
  virtual-MIDI port, no 7-bit byte encoding, true bidirectional streaming.
- **Piano-roll editing that actually works.** FL's `flpianoroll` module is
  sandboxed to piano-roll scripts; fLMCP stages edits to a JSON file, then
  fires the companion pyscript via a synthesised `Ctrl+Alt+Y` so the notes
  are inserted on FL's own main thread.
- **High-level music generators.** `gen_emit_chord_progression`,
  `gen_emit_bassline`, `gen_emit_drum_pattern` (boom-bap / trap / DnB /
  reggaeton / house / amen-break / rock …), `gen_emit_arpeggio`,
  `gen_emit_melody` — write full musical ideas with one tool call.
- **Voice-to-MIDI.** Hum a melody, get it in the piano roll. Optional scale
  snap, quantize, transpose, confidence filtering. Standalone Dear PyGui
  window with live waveform + pitch readout for interactive edits.
- **Audio-file analysis.** Drop any MP3 / WAV / FLAC / OGG on it — get back
  tempo, detected key, onsets, and (optionally) the dominant melody
  transcribed into FL's piano roll.
- **Push events.** `transport.tick`, `refresh`, `projectLoad` are streamed
  back so Claude can react to what the user is doing in FL without polling.

### Why TCP and not MIDI

The earlier projects all relied on loopMIDI plus 7-bit byte encoding, which is
painful and fragile. FL Studio 2025 ships Python 3.12 with `_socket.pyd`, so
the bridge simply opens a local TCP server inside FL. No extra driver, no 7-bit
limit, true bidirectional streaming, free push notifications.

### Why a separate piano-roll pyscript

The `flpianoroll` module (the only way to insert / delete notes) is **only**
available inside piano-roll scripts. Device / controller scripts can't
`import` it. fLMCP stages the requested edits into a JSON file, then
synthesises `Ctrl+Alt+Y` in the FL Studio window via Win32 `SendInput`, which
fires the companion pyscript to apply the edits and write the new state back.

## Install (Windows)

Requirements:

- Windows 10 / 11
- FL Studio 2025 (Producer Edition or higher — needs MIDI scripting)
- Python 3.10+ on `PATH` (used once to create the bundled venv)

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/geezoria/FLStudioMCP.git fLMCP
cd fLMCP
./scripts/install_windows.ps1
```

What the installer does:

1. Copies `fl_bridge/device_FLStudioMCP.py` to
   `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Image-Line\FL Studio\Settings\Hardware\fLMCP Bridge\`
2. Copies `fl_bridge/piano_roll/ComposeWithLLM.pyscript` to
   `...\Settings\Piano roll scripts\`
3. Creates `.venv\` and installs the MCP package editable, **with the
   `[audio,gui]` extras** (voice-to-MIDI + audio analysis). Pass `-SkipAudio`
   to install the core only.
4. Adds an `fl-studio-mcp` entry to `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   (and to Claude Code's config if present).

### FL Studio-side activation

1. Launch FL Studio 2025.
2. `Options > MIDI Settings > Input`: pick **any** row (even a device you
   don't use) and set **Controller type** = `fLMCP Bridge`, then click *Enable*.
   - If you don't own a MIDI device at all, install
     [loopMIDI](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html), create
     a port called `fLMCP loop`, and bind that row. The bridge just needs *any*
     input line wired so FL loads the script — no MIDI bytes actually flow.
3. Open FL's script output (`Options > MIDI > View script output`) and look
   for `[fLMCP] TCP server listening on 127.0.0.1:9876`.
4. Open any piano roll, click the scripts dropdown (top-right), and pick
   **ComposeWithLLM** as the active script. This binds `Ctrl+Alt+Y` to our
   pyscript. FL remembers the choice across sessions.
5. Restart Claude Desktop / Claude Code so it picks up the new MCP entry.

### Optional extras

Voice-to-MIDI and audio-file analysis bring in heavier dependencies
(`sounddevice`, `librosa`, `soundfile`, `numpy`, `scipy`, `dearpygui`). The
Windows installer already installs them; on other platforms:

```bash
pip install "fl-studio-mcp[audio]"
```

## Quick check

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\smoke_test.py
```

Expected output: project metadata, transport status, the first few channels /
mixer tracks / patterns, and a tempo ramp demonstration.

## Example conversations with Claude

> *"Open FL Studio, create a new pattern called 'Verse Beat', make a boom-bap
> drum groove on channels 0–2, a minor-key bassline in C2 on channel 3, and a
> i–VII–VI–V chord progression on channel 4."*

```python
pattern_create(name="Verse Beat")
gen_emit_drum_pattern(channel_map={"kick": 0, "snare": 1, "clhat": 2},
                     style="boom_bap", repeats=1)
gen_emit_bassline(channel=3, root="C2", scale="minor",
                  progression="i-VII-VI-V", pattern_style="octaves")
gen_emit_chord_progression(channel=4, progression="i-VII-VI-V",
                           root="C4", scale="minor")
transport_play()
```

> *"Take this 90s breakbeat, detect the key and tempo, and flip it into
> a 174 BPM DnB loop — amen-break drums, sub-bass on the detected root,
> and the track's own melody on top."*

```python
song_to_dnb_flip(audio_path="C:/samples/break.wav",
                 target_bpm=174, dnb_style="amen",
                 include_melody=True, include_bass=True)
```

> *"I'll hum a riff for 8 seconds — snap it to C minor, quantize to 1/16
> at 120 BPM, and write it to the open piano roll."*

```python
voice_to_piano_roll(duration_sec=8, bpm=120,
                    scale_root="C", scale="minor",
                    quantize_grid_sec=0.125)
```

Or the interactive route — Claude opens the GUI:

```python
voice_open_gui()   # Dear PyGui window with live waveform + pitch readout
```

## Tool catalogue (159 tools + 7 resources)

Full reference with signatures: [`docs/TOOLS.md`](docs/TOOLS.md).

| Area | Count | Highlights |
| --- | :-: | --- |
| Meta | 4 | ping, reconnect, bridge info, raw escape hatch |
| Transport | 14 | play / stop / record, tempo, time sig, metronome, jog |
| Patterns | 13 | create, rename, clone, color, length, find-by-name |
| Channels | 20 | full rack, step sequencer get / set, routing, trigger |
| Mixer | 18 | vol / pan / mute / solo / arm, sends, EQ, FX slots, routing |
| Plugins | 13 | get / set / search params, preset navigation, editor |
| Piano roll | 10 | add, read, clear, quantize, transpose, humanize, duplicate |
| Playlist | 14 | tracks, clips (limited), markers |
| Arrangement | 5 | current, list, select, jump marker |
| Automation | 5 | tempo, channel vol / pan, mixer vol, plugin params |
| Project | 11 | metadata, save, save-as, undo / redo, render |
| UI | 7 | show / hide windows, hints, focus |
| Generators | 14 | scales, chords, progressions, arpeggios, basslines, drums |
| Voice-to-MIDI | 5 | record + transcribe + scale-snap + send to FL, GUI |
| Audio | 5 | analyze MP3 / WAV, slice at onsets, melody → piano roll, DnB flip |
| MCP resources | 7 | `fl://project`, `fl://mixer`, `fl://patterns`, … |

## Resources Claude can read without a tool call

- `fl://status` — bridge + transport snapshot
- `fl://project` — full project metadata
- `fl://transport` — live transport state
- `fl://channels` — entire channel rack
- `fl://mixer` — all mixer tracks
- `fl://patterns` — every pattern
- `fl://playlist` — playlist tracks, clips, markers

Great for getting oriented ("what does the project look like right now?")
before issuing edits.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
| --- | --- |
| `bridge unavailable` from tool calls | FL not running, or the controller script isn't loaded. Open `Options > MIDI Settings > Input` and enable a row with Controller type = `fLMCP Bridge`. |
| TCP bind error in FL output | Another copy of fLMCP is running, or firewall blocking `127.0.0.1:9876`. Close the other instance and allow `FL64.exe` in Windows Defender. |
| Piano-roll edits don't apply | fLMCP focuses FL Studio and sends `Ctrl+Alt+Y`. If you rebound the hotkey, or FL can't be foregrounded, press `Ctrl+Alt+Y` manually once after the tool call. |
| Hotkey fires the wrong script | Open any piano roll → right-click the script dropdown → set `ComposeWithLLM` as the default. |
| `playlist_place_pattern` returns a structured error | FL's public Python API does not yet expose clip placement. Documented in [`docs/LIMITATIONS.md`](docs/LIMITATIONS.md). |
| `voice_*` tools error with `no module named sounddevice` | Install the audio extras: `pip install "fl-studio-mcp[audio]"` (or re-run `install_windows.ps1`). |
| `voice_to_piano_roll` returns 0 notes | Hum louder, check `voice_list_devices()` for the right mic, or lower `min_confidence`. |
| `audio_analyze` can't open MP3 | Install `ffmpeg` and make sure it's on `PATH` (librosa falls back to it for compressed formats). |

## Development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/Scripts/activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux
pip install -e ".[dev]"       # core + pytest (add [audio,gui] for the full stack)
pytest
```

Tests in `tests/` run entirely offline — the TCP bridge is faked, the FL-side
script is imported with its FL-only modules stubbed out, and the core server
builds without the audio extras. You don't need FL Studio (or numpy/librosa)
running to execute the suite.

See [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) for what changed between releases.
