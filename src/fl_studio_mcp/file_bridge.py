"""
File-based bridge for piano roll operations.

Works without loopMIDI / any MIDI device — the MCP server writes a request
file that the `ComposeWithLLM.pyscript` (piano roll pyscript) picks up when
it runs. The server triggers the pyscript by synthesising Ctrl+Alt+Y into the
FL Studio window. The pyscript then writes a state file we read back.

This complements `bridge_client.py` (TCP over MIDI controller script).
