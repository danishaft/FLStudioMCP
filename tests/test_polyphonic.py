"""Tests for polyphonic transcription (Spotify Basic Pitch integration).

The conversion from Basic Pitch's output to our Note list is pure and is tested
here against the EXACT tuple shape Basic Pitch emits (verified against the real
library: note_events are 5-tuples
``(start_s, end_s, pitch_midi, amplitude, pitch_bends)``). basic-pitch itself is
an optional heavy extra and is not required to run these tests.
